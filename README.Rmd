# shinybp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `shinybp` is to document a collection of shiny app testing best practices (and *hopefully* generate a test report with a traceability matrix) 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `shinybp` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjfrigaard/shinybp")
```

## To-dos

1. Create a documented list of shiny app testing best practices  
   - differentiate between:
     - unit testing  
     - integration testing  
     - sanity tests  
     - system testing  
    
2. Create a demo application for listing features and performing tests  
   - [x] `dataViewApp` (demo): 
      - The `dataViewApp` has: 
        1. modules   
        2. utility functions  
        3. conditional UI features  
        4. uploads  
        5. downloads
